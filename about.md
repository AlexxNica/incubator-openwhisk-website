I.e. that it provides you with a serverless deployment and operations model hiding infrastructural complexity.

It allows [developers]({{ site.github.url }}/developers) to focus on quickly developing value-adding code by providing them with a flexible programming model that allows to develop in different languages, by providing access to a rich service ecosystem of event emitters and consumers from different vendors falling into different domains like analytics, cognitive,data, mobile, IoT and so forth, and by relieving them from the need to worry about complex low-level infrastructural and operational tasks.

It makes it easy for [service integrators]({{ site.github.url }}/service-integrators) to let their service become part of Apache OpenWhiskâ€™s ecosystem to drive traffic & usage.

It allows [open-source contributors]({{ site.github.url }}/contributors) to become part of a strong community, to learn something new, and to broaden their skillset.
