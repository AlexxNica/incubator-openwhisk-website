Apache OpenWhisk is a cloud-first distributed event-based programming service. It provides a programming model to upload event handlers to a cloud service, and register the handlers to respond to various events.

## Quickstart for Local Development

**NOTE:** This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so you'll need to run `gem install jekyll` if you don't have it installed already.

``` sh
# Clone the repository (and correct branch).
git clone https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk.github.io.git

# Move into the cloned repo.
cd openwhisk.github.io

# Start the development server.
bin/develop
```
