OpenWhisk is a cloud-first distributed event-based programming service. It represents an event-action platform that allows you to execute code in response to an event.

Serverless computing refers to a model where the existence of servers is simply hidden from developers. I.e. that even though servers still exist developers are relieved from the need to care about their operation. They are relieved from the need to worry about low-level infrastructural and operational details such as scalability, high-availability, infrastructure-security, and so forth. Hence, serverless computing is essentially about reducing maintenance efforts to allow developers to quickly focus on developing value-adding code.

Serverless computing encourages and simplifies developing microservice-oriented solutions in order to decompose complex applications into small and independent modules that can be easily exchanged.

Serverless computing does not refer to a specific technology; instead if refers to the concepts underlying the model described prior. Nevertheless some promising solutions have recently emerged easing development approaches that follow the serverless model – such as OpenWhisk.
